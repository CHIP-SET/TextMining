Clinical TextMining
==========

The clinical text mining use-case concerns the exchange and reuse of textmining software in two ways: 

  - As source code for the reuse by other text miners
  - As an executable artefact for reuse by Health Informaticians 

The goal is to develop pattern for creating "research objects" that provide the data and metadata required for successful reuse.
